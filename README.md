# Why_Happy


Countries have a face, reputation, each providence, department, state has a set of unique traits and idiosyncrasies, as humans we speak indistinctly and irresponsibly about the context of any country, it is like guessing numbers with a little bit in hand, and this is understandably, we share the big picture blindness because as individuals we cannot see for everyone, so how is it possible to talk and speculate about a certain population? Off-course statistics, polls, and metrics are social studies responses that take a snapshot of the present that is no longer present and we make inferences that sometimes or may not fit a specific interest.The old known problem of data interpretation.


According to the [Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/countries/colombia#conflict), Colombia is one of the happiest countries in the world, but where is the smile that comes from the quick conclusion? Where are the missing data in history? Why are there other data that seem to measure different things under the same irresponsible assumption about happiness across countries?
Since 1948 the city of Bogotá remains as the place where a dead person starts a "movement", on April 9 Jorge Eliezer Gaitán, candidate for the elections on behalf of a liberal party, was assassinated for his ideals, that day he was baptized as Bogotazo and was led to a massive riot sparked by anger and despair that will eventually lead to a dark time in Colombia known as "La Violencia."

"The violence" was just that, outright violence between brothers, the conflict ends ten years later but the violence remains with other names and surnames, political parties, privileges, even moral debts to this day.

Even after the peace accords, Colombia is suffering a tacit violence that disappears, silences and fades those smiles, those people who want to amend peace and truth for families and for themselves. Today, May 2021, it seems that Colombians rise together against those who try to reduce this effort for the truth, they are together for the rights and dignity of the people and against the coherence of the dictatorial discourse, the aggressive manipulation of the media, La Obvious corruption, but irresponsible assumptions about people become a sad reality when data is lacking to understand a specific context, there is no real-time processing in any country that reflects a situation. It is a paradox, the human who does not know his history is condemned to repeat it, and whoever does not live his present is a prisoner of a future made by others.

From the perspective of the process in data science and having a lens of historiography, the "[[History of the present]]" is a matter of collecting data in real time with the approach of the methodologies of the social sciences, the only thing that remains is the question. But the question seems misleading when it comes to happiness. It is not just one question, there are many.

- What is happiness?
- How you can measure a subjective experience such happiness in cauntitative values?
- Where is the theory behind the measure of the happy index and based on what?
- Why the individual answer to subjective question represent the all collective experience of the population?
- How you sampling the subjects and how can be representative?
- What is the meaning of the "Happiness Index" and to whom its useful this information?
- Why this kind of index are biased from correlation with the present of population perspective?

In the data analytic context there are challenges when it comes to data collection such as:

- The amount of data
- Collecting meaningfull and real-time data
- Sources and accesibility of data
- Quality of data
- Third party interest
- Visualization of those data.


This project aims to investigate the irresponsible assumptions of the populations and will approach the problem from the perspective of the data engineer task. Data mining through different sources of "real time data", basic data and more that allows processing with NLP analysis as a way of expressing the History of the present in Colombia.
